# AirYMAGIN

AirYMAGIN is a standalone Java application built using a Swing GUI. It was created as part of an escape room fundraising project run by the YMAGIN (Youth MAndate for Greater Involvement) committee of the IITB (Innovation, Information, and Technology) branch of ESDC (Employment and Social Development Canada). AirYMAGIN acts as a login page, asking the gamer (individual playing the escape room) for a username and password that they have to find as part of the game. To discourage participants from just guessing, unsuccessful attempts to enter the credentials cause them to lose access attempts, eventually causing them to be locked out of the system. If they are successful in entering the right credentials they will be brought to a victory screen and given the confirmation phrase to prove they completed the room.

## Using the application

Running the application is simple. Just open the runnable AirYMAGIN.jar to start the application. Once shown the setup screen enter the credentials to be used and click start. Once finished exit the application and start it again to begin a new round.
